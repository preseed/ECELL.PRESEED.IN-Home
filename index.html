                                Todoed is made up of I(could be the ceo) and Dhaval(could be the cto) full time. And
                                there are two
                                part time advisors (passive tech advisor - Saikiran and fairly active tech advisor/hands
                                on
                                coder/backend Ansal). <br>
                                This is the Todoed core team - I and Dhaval. This is all I need. This, all the way to
                                cover,
                                chrome extension(all to do with text - 75% done) and iOS (all to do with voice and
                                text). This is
                                the iOS/backend/marketing/design team. <br>
                                It is Todoed on iOS that ultimately will solve my own problem fully that I envisioned it
                                to do for
                                me first. Todoed as a chrome extension has been able to do it only partly. <br>
                                I started my journey to inspire ideas, faith (in each other), and action among all I
                                come in
                                contact with. So, I started Preseed. Found Dhaval on that journey and mandated him to
                                build upon
                                my vision for the product, that productifies Preseed, to enable more potential
                                entrepreneurs to
                                build. The prototype is here <a href="http://myidealist.co">www.myidealist.co</a> . Now
                                while
                                journeying over this I realised a problem with my own fellows and community at Preseed,
                                where
                                actionable tasks sent over chat, kept getting lost. I told Dhaval to transfer the task
                                of building
                                MyIdealist to our other coworkers at Preseed and join me asap at building Todoed. <br>
                                In brief the above paragraph should give you a glimse over my exact motivation: <br><br>
                                1. To make people more productive. <br>
                                2. For the purpose of building ideas. <br> <br>
                                Todoed should help people be more productive for the purpose of building ideas. Some day
                                a text
                                with '#idea' in Todoed will create more possibilities for users of Todoed to transition
                                that idea
                                into a MVP and then perhaps a startup. That day Todoed and MyIdealist will be very
                                closely
                                integrated. But this year, that can even be a part of dialogue. Because this year is
                                about
                                everything in Todoed except this '#idea'.
                                <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
                                This is Todoed being built for the present or what I call 'the Todoed operational
                                parallel': <br>
                                <br>
                                We get tremendous invaluable support from Preseed, the noise free community of self
                                inspired
                                potential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, I started 3 years ago. That support will
                                continue
                                forever. That support means the ball at Todoed is always rolling. The hustle is always
                                on.
                                Independent of money, office, materials. It's a bonus. Large bonus. That is capable of
                                producing
                                the product, even if Dhaval and I were not there. (But Dhaval is there, has been and
                                will be,
                                forever, so had/have/will I. I have shared a profound and deeply action oriented
                                relationship with
                                Dhaval for 2 years now). <br>
                                Preseed is now represented through Govind, coordinator at Preseed; to Raj, who handles
                                Todoed at
                                Preseed, and hence is the coordinator at Todoed, meaning Raj's mandate is to extract the
                                juices
                                out of the Preseed team/network for the purpose of building Todoed, independent of the
                                works of
                                the core team of Todoed. <br>
                                Operational parallel: Raj; under my day to day directions and suggestions in freelance
                                arrangement
                                with Ansal, and advisory from Kartik Mandavidalle; with an open access to human
                                resources of
                                Preseed. This is how we have so far, Built the chrome extension; measuring it, learning
                                it,
                                repeating it. All the way to making it the best productivity chrome extension in the
                                world. This
                                is truly exactly the process that built Todoed thus far. And that is the exact process
                                that will
                                continue to build it further over the next 3 months. <br>
                                We think our chrome extension will be perfect by that time. While this is going on, Raj
                                will
                                continue to market the product and study the user metric and behavior. And then further
                                market it
                                upon those lessons. This is all about the Chrome extension. <br>
                                So there is also Raj in the Todoed team. He was my second in command at Preseed. Now he
                                is my
                                second in command in Todoed. <br>
                                Three of us are building Todoed at 0 costs to Todoed, from our own homes, I in Lucknow,
                                Raj in
                                Kolkatta, Dhaval in Ranchi. Whatever little server/freelancer costs, Preseed/Preseed
                                network takes
                                care of it. That is how we have done things and can do for a long period of time. We
                                are,in one
                                regard, self sustained. <br>
                                However, if we raise money, I can raise the bar -: <br> <br>
                                <br> 1. I want to set up a beautiful conducive office/infrastructure in Lucknow to come
                                under one
                                roof to build and grow a great roof to work from, physically also together, not just
                                mentally.
                                <br> 2. Build the product to my satisfaction in 3 months, and take I and Dhaval to
                                Silicon Valley
                                (leaving Raj and others to hustle in India), to work closely with a marketer/growth
                                hacker who has
                                been there done that. We want to go to him with a product, which is ready to be marketed
                                at his

                                <strong> What is the change I want to bring about?</strong> <br><br>
                                I want to trigger the hacking youth of India to STARTUP, regardless of their current available
                                resources. I also then want to inspire better ideas, more faith and fast action in them. So that
                                there are better leaders made and better companies built in India. <br><br>
                                <strong> How would I do that? </strong><br><br>
                                I would do that by being there for them, with them, through Preseed. <br><br>
                                <strong> How would I be there for those I am committing to be there for?</strong> <br><br>
                                The system design of Preseed is looking good enough to ensure this call for action, orderly. We
                                have spent a great deal of time in laying the foundation, culture and the system of Preseed to
                                ensure that each idea we list and each individual we handle translates into becoming a startup
                                someday. <br><br>
                                Worst case, if not each, some would translate into startups and that itself would be impactful
                                to say the least. <br><br>
                                We have filled the system of Preseed with so much inspiration that money is not needed to
                                sustain it for a long period of time. So sustenance is not a problem. Here everyone works for
                                their equity share of what is being built. However, to scale things we may look to money some
                                day, but, now is not the day. <br><br>
                                <strong> What may be the result of all this?</strong> </strong><br><br>
                                The result may be that those who have the will to do something out of the ordinary will now have
                                place to go to, called Preseed. As a result of that, some good startup ideas may occur. As a
                                result of that, some startups may get seeded. As a result of that, some important problems of
                                the world may get solved. <br><br>
                                <strong> What is the current status?</strong> <br><br>
                                Among our collaborators are some really talented people who are building with us a bunch of
                                inspiring things. The current status is - a few hings are getting built, few codes are getting
                                written, few designs are being made and a lot of hustle is being done. A lot of very talented
                                people have joined us, as entrepreneurs, to build upon our ideas already. Some of them are
                                listed here.

                                To convey a meaning when you write the first word, you put a dot first. Then you run your pen to
                                grow that dot into a word that has some meaning. And all these different words together form a
                                story. Every time an author nurtures that dot, he ends up with a story, that may sell. So, dot
                                is the point of initiation where a word, a story, a line or an organisation, everything
                                originates from. Pen Dot:Word :: Preseed Dot:Startup

                                We will personally inspire, co-build and educate you on business values we believe in. Most of
                                it is counter cultured. But that is what works in these extraordinary ‘internet’ times of FREE
                                information and FREE tools' that have led to more noise than information of value.<br><br>
        
                                1. Mentorship/Advise — Our advice will lead you to decipher the startup plan, its phases and
                                over all strategies so crisp and simple that it actually STARTS bootstrapped and conducts itself
                                in smarter and contemporary ways. We continue to function as advisors throughout the course of
                                the business so long as you feel our need.<br><br>
        
                                2. Scale up Connections — These connections are thoughtfully created potential tie ups that make
                                the process of building a great company faster, more efficient, more cost effective and more
                                scalable. We create a structure around you that leaves you more time to focus on what is most
                                critical to your business so that you do what is most important and others do everything else.
                                These tie ups could be infrastructural tie ups, operational tie ups, process tie ups, technology
                                tieups, human resource tie ups or any other tie up that can help grow the startup.<br><br>

                                vendors we have identified as most cost effective vendors over our experience of the last 5

                                goal with you. We hope you understand that most ideas that people write to us about are
                                redefined by us, sometimes even completely changed. (Obviously in the interest of the business).

        While the MVP of your product is being planned from our location, we take full responsibility to teach you to
        market it prior to even the first lines of codes are written. As your MVP gets readied from our location with
        your remote team, and also customer-validated under our supervision, we proceed to help you understand the other
        non-product elements of that idea, the culture that will strengthen your startup.<br><br>
        An e.g. of that hustle is — the <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51">prelaunch
          marketing</a>, which we ourselves did for each of our own products before we went on to make them. <br><br>
        We need you to be under the same roof as us to teach you what we did with our products.<br><br>
        To sum up -:<br><br>
        1. You need to build a team of inspired hacker, designer and hustler per idea so that you can be incubated at a
        worthy startup incubator with your product.<br><br>
        2. You need to ensure that before the product’s single line is coded the product already has atleast 500
        pre-launch subscribers.<br><br>
        3. You need to ensure that the product’s MVP is working well for the early adopters.<br><br>
        4. You need to do all of this without burning a single penny because we believe web startups can be/should be
        MVPed at 0 monetary costs, just the way we did it for our products. <br><br><!-- <b>The cost of infrastructure will be, however, born by Preseed Ecell till you are here with us.</b>-->
       <br><br>
        BTW, you are welcome to live with us for free, if you are a student with an obsession of the world of consumer
        mobile apps, and have the love for technology enough to learn how to code, design and market it, all nearly
        equally then this may be the best training ground for you. In short if we could define you as -: ‘a new age web
        hustler’ willing to ‘drop out’ of his college to help us build ‘Preseed’ over and above anything else, till you
        have an altruistic idea of your own.<br><br>
        I assure you the result of the knowledge you will garner here over a period of 1 year would empower you enough
        to build a technology startup of your own someday soon, and that too, with a very mature perspective.<br><br>
        Condition: Your entire focus must be on the strategies we are proposing. <br><br>

<em><b>Are you here to have us flow your startup deal in among our network of investors?</b></em> 

<p>We hustle with you all the way to facilitate investments for your startup, and we take some commission for brokering that deal. But that is the last and least of what we will do. That is merely a by product of what needs to be done on you, for you, that you get investment itself in the first place. </p><br>

<p>Dealflow is not about floating some deal to an investor like a broker. It is about being able to tell your story better than you can. I mean you can blow your own trumpet, but understand the difference between you blowing your own trumpet. Furthermore, understand the difference between anyone else blowing your trumpet and us blowing your trumpet. Dealflow is about story telling of your brand to be. It is not just for the investors but also for your teams. It is that which creates a possibility of ‘inspiration’ for your business. Inspiration because when we evangelise, we don’t just sell, we inspire. <br>
Your measure of on boarding us, must be, in your ability to gauge if we can be the best story tellers you can have, such that, even in your absence your story is not only told, but also heard with awe and inspiration. At this stage of your startup, your story will sell better than your status quo. </p>
<br>
<b>How do we understand your story?</b>
<br>
<p>
We spend countless hours in conversations with you, recording those conversations, editing them wherever necessary to send it to the network of our mentors to hear it to improve it and then training you to internalise it as not just your story but now a collective story of you and Preseed team together in context to your business. It is in this story that the face value of your team gets the face value of our team too. It is in this story that you ultimately raise money, repeatedly. It’s not a one time act. It is in this story that we on-board people for your team whenever we find one. It is in this story that our team and your team get synchronised, (or any team, because we tell it so) as if one. </p>
<br>
<p>
For doing so, we take an upfront minimum equity. This is the only reason why we would invest our time and energy on your startup. <b>Even listening to your story, your pains, your business or your dream, will cost us time and money; with effect from now.</b> We will charge for it upfront. 
<br>
Step 1 - Please <a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed/tagged/contracts" target="_blank">dig the termsheets</a> on our medium essays to understand the terms. 
<br>
Step 2 - Copy and paste them, sign them and send to us. 
<br>
Our contracts are non negotiable in nature. They are standards we follow with every startup.

                          <p>Later we will scale it to a space where we will hold talks from across topics like science,

                            Education and Entrepreneurship. For all that should have been taught to children before they
                            turn 18. Because what they learn becomes the future of our country. We want to run it as a
                            modern ashram for students and entrepreneurs. One day we hope to serve India by making
                            Preseed Ecell become home to deserving students and innovators.</p>

                          A school in delhi to educate those entrepreneurial spirited students who are forced to chase a
                          recognised education degree by their parents instead of building something. So we decided to
                          give them a degree that can further their cause, without them having to rebel against their
                          parents.
                          <br></br>
                          <b>Delhi Startup School:</b> This is what we are going to call it.
                          <br></br>
                          Guiding Principle -: All it takes is, being forever ready to reach out to anyone in the world
                          through the internet.
                          <br></br>
                          Over the last 10 years in Delhi I have come to realise that the culture of entrepreneurship,
                          even though is on the rise, still doesn’t educate on the essence of simplicity, bootstrapping
                          and quick launch.
                          <br></br>
                          Anyway, that being the broader life skill we wan’t be able to conclusively impart by running a
                          programme -:
                          <br></br>
                          <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51" target="_blank">
                            <h4>‘Marketing Precedes Coding’</h4>
                          </a>
                          <br>
                          (Do read the article linked with this heading). Some of the points of training students in
                          this specific field is that -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. Hackers can be found because hackers have enough tools on the web to learn hacking from
                          like on mentioned on this kippt list and enough platforms to shoot their queries to, to feed
                          on their curiosity. Moreover there are many programmes to train people in programing.<br>
                          2. Designers are those who are artists in their soul anyway. They will figure their route to
                          becoming designers anyway. They too have too many schools, programmes and online tools to
                          begin with.<br>
                          3. Hustler — This guy is the guy who is enterprising enough to go out there on the ground and
                          connect the dots. One of his main jobs is to be able to <b>market the idea</b> that he is
                          going out there to create. <b>We want to train this guy over how marketing is done in this new
                            age way even prior to the product is built.</b><br>
                          4. Above all, this is the chance for graduates to get in tune with the world their colleges
                          never taught them about. The world of building startups.<br></br>
                          So clearly this programme is for those who are specifically interested in learning digital
                          marketing for the purpose of product launches. For these guys truly understand the importance
                          of being able to launch their future idea even if there was little to no money to doing so.
                          <br></br>
                          We will essentially teach you about distribution of web and mobile apps through educating you
                          over -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. How were some of the most extraordinary companies built?<br>
                          2. What does the contemporary startup ecosystem of the world look like after the creation of
                          products like Angellist?<br>
                          3. What is a good idea?<br>
                          4. The tools that empower us in building a company.<br>
                          5. Above all, the new age ways of marketing because the web has become extremely social, thus,
                          changing the landscape of past ways of marketing still being taught in a lot of MBA
                          Schools.<br>
                          6. Above all we will teach you how to use the internet to learn.<br></br>
                          <b>We will train you over a period of 1 year and give you a degree in Masters in
                            Entrepreneurship.</b> We will put you through real job scenarios to give you good insights
                          into what it takes to really build something from technology to design.
                          <br></br>
                          Above all we would impart in you the culture Preseed is being built upon. In doing so every
                          member of the Preseed team will come forward to teaching you a thing or two. <b>Hence, every
                            one from the <a href="http://preseed.in/team" target="_blank">Preseed Team</a> is a mentor
                            here. These are the men you could learn from apart from our own set of educators hand picked
                            from the industry.</b>
                          <br></br>
                          Yes, we will give you a UGC recognized degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship too. However, if
                          you are really coming to us so that you could startup your own business really really soon,
                          you will never have to need your degree certificate.
                          <br></br>
                          The fees of the Programme is Rs. 1, 50, 000 per year.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope -:
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you understand we are training you not only for your job as a marketer at a good tech
                          startup, but to help you build one yourself someday.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you also realise that if you are neither a designer nor a hacker and you still want to
                          be able to be a co founder in a tech startup right from it’s day 1, you need to be the guy who
                          can prelaunch it for customer validation the moment your product’s 1st version is ready. This
                          is the gap you will fill in the team of 2 people, one hacker and one designer, building a
                          product.
                          <br></br>
                          However if you are designer or a hacker, and yet wish to learn to distribute tech products on
                          the web, please join in. You will learn a lot beyond your current skills.

	<h4>Bootstrapping leads to simplicity.</h4>
Since little to no money is infused in the making of Preseed, it has remained bootstrapped to not even have set up an office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking spaces/cafes where our collaborators sit, think and do. In fact we are bootstrapped to the extent that our core team gets built not out of monthly compensations but out of inspiration to chase a common goal with us. We have learned what it means to stay bootstrapped. It means to stay simple. It means to — not be in a hurry.
<br><br>
Our appetite to not only stay bootstrapped ourselves but also keep our startups bootstrapped allows us to push ourselves to look for hacks in codes, in designs, in marketing, in hiring and overall business building. That, in turn, keeps our operational costs to an unbelievable low. That we think is a very important attribute of Preseed as a business organization made up of extraordinary hustle.
<br><br>
Basically we have begun to understand the importance of bootstrapping for ones growth as a leader. For, we have found ourselves to grow leaps and bounds since Preseed started in a moment of no penny even to pay phone bills. It led Nishchal to become simpler. We are pretty sure those lessons are leading his team to a path of simplicity, where a failure of business doesn't mean the failure of a human.
<br><br>
<h4>We once asked Nishchal, "what does simplicity lead to"?</h4>

I will explain that with an example of a moment of thought while trying to go into a state of meditation. When you close your eyes and imagine, you imagine with greater clarity, sometimes enough clarity to experience what you are imagining near visually. So basically all the visual noise of the outside vanishes when you shut your eyes. Now you are only imagining. There is no outside noise. So when you start becoming simpler and start shedding off the extra, this is what happens. The backdrop in which you imagine becomes clean and boundless. <b>Simplicity leads to boundlessness</b>.

			<h2>Usability</h2>
			<p  style="font-size: 17px;">After vision this is where we spend most of our time. We keep it to what's needed and where it's needed. Nothing that is not needed will ever find its way into our products.</p>
			<p  style="font-size: 17px;">Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems we see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design' sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products.</p>

				<p class="lead">"Usability and the utility, not the visual design, determine the success or failure of a web-app. Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design.

			<h2>Lean</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px;">We take it a step further. Lean is how we
				<strong>live</strong>, let alone build stuff. We
				<em>'build, measure, learn, repeat'</em>and never raise funds without setting it right.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 16px;">Bootstrapping has its own entrepreneurial lessons that cannot be learnt without self experiencing them. We iterate, customer validate and reiterate. If we fail, we also fail fast, we re-iterate even faster and all of that, at minimum cost implications. In short we make sure we customer validate the products before we look to move to the next steps of development.

                        Here education through entrepreneurship for empowerment happens through spaces, unlike

                      <br><br>
                      Imagine a place for extra-ordinary people who have full access to their dreams. All the resources
                      are made available to them and they have all the freedom to bring out the best in them. Yes,
                      <strong> we
                        are talking about a co-living for extra-ordinary people</strong>. <br><br>
                      We would like to build a community of all those crazy talented individuals who when pulled
                      together can produce revolutionary technology products. We will choose those best ones from our
                      campaigns and provide them a platform through a co-living and co-working away from the city, even
                      if within a city. Such will be the environment and surroundings of such a place. <br><br>
                      Another co-founder of Preseed Prints, Paras Pundir, has this to say after understanding my vision
                      and launch strategy of it, “We strongly believe that there is a need of this unique kind of
                      community in India. Many will be there who would like to become a part of this revolution and from
                      there comes the idea of crowdfunding this campaign with the best content and networks. Mostly it
                      will be provided by Nishchal. We will run this campaign over one of the best crowdfunding platform
                      called Indiegogo. We plan to make this campaign reach more than one lakh appropriate people in
                      India. <br><br>
                      About myself, having a keen interest in building communities and helping people to bring out their
                      best, I’ll be taking care of all the marketing and community building activities. In past, I have
                      built few most engaging communities from the scratch say a community of Product Managers, Quality
                      Analysts, UX designers, Community Managers, footballers and a little more. I have been helping
                      other startups and community persons in keeping their big communities alive. I would be very much
                      interested in this community of extra-ordinaries”.

                      <h4>Preseed E-cell Spaces</h4>

                      In today’s age of simple and well designed web tools for collaboration, if one starts using them
                      well, no one would really require to book office spaces when they are a team of 2–3 working out of
                      their homes. However, each in the team needs to be intrinsically motivated to do so. Remote
                      working is the future of boundless collaborations. <br><br>
                      Am I saying that people don’t need offices? I am saying that people don’t need offices
                      prematurely. They need offices when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, they should just bootstrap
                      their style of work. <br><br>
                      When it becomes absolutely necessary they should come and spend sometime at a place like Preseed
                      E-cell Spaces. <br><br>
                      <i>We are helping build this space further with a simple thought in our minds, that if about over
                        50
                        crazy ones who are building things with us are placed under one roof every single day, an
                        incredible amount of learning can take place. <br><br>
                        We really do feel that working in isolation of the vibe of the progressive conversations takes
                        away the possibility of incredibly valuable advise and perspectives.</i> <br><br>
                      Preseed E-cell spaces are a proposed cafe, co-working and co-living where you could come and co
                      create with others like you and us. This space is that environment we have always envisioned as a
                      required creative space for a budding entrepreneur. A place where you could come and spend your
                      time collaboratively and creatively at. <br><br>
                      Through such space we aim to create an open environment for co creation and innovation. Over a
                      period of time we hope to be the place you brainstormed all stages of your startup at. <br><br>
                      In Preseed Ecell spaces, you start, unlike your college where you do everything but start. We
                      clearly believe that entrepreneurship is not something that can be taught in a classroom full of
                      structured courses common for all. Entrepreneurship is a drive that occurs through self motivation
                      arising out of your own story. It can’t be taught by professors at colleges. Here we just hope to
                      create a ‘go to place’ for you where you could start.

                      Features (this is how we envision the space by June 2018 with the following key elements) –

                        believe that, this space will make you feel empowered to start before you thought you

                      The difference between boot camps, Incubators or any other entrepreneurship initiative and
                      <strong> Preseed
                        E-cell spaces</strong> is that this space is not something that finishes like an event does.
                      Once an event
                      finishes what happens to the ‘Entrepreneur’, where does he go thereafter. Preseed ecell space is a
                      place that remains and you can come here as many times you want. It never finishes on you.

                      <h3>
                        There are four basic recurring events within preseed:-
                      </h3>



                      1. Delhi Meetup: <br>

                      <br><br>2. Demo Day: <br>
                      The first demo day, is when the startups who are already sort of up and running will come and they
                      will get to know in one session what Preseed is all about and how Preseed can help them. After
                      this
                      on the same day there will be one on one meetings with the people who want to talk about their
                      association or plan with preseed. The startups who require straight away investing will then be
                      shortlisted for the Investor’s Demo Day after 7 days. The ones that need help to bootstrap will
                      meet
                      with Nischal and discuss their plan with Preseed from then on.
                      <br><br>3. Investors Demo Day: <br>
                      On this day, the startups that require investing will be invited to demonstrate their business
                      plan
                      to a panel of interested investors and funds. They will be shortlisted from here by the investors

                          We envision TSF having an office in Silicon Valley, where we will accelerate startups. We
                          are very well positioned in India to get brilliant, handpicked Indian early stage startups
                          to get baked there. The founders from our handpicked startups will eventually go to Silicon
                          Valley for this Accelerator Program. In the meantime they will be in India and be
                          accelerated from Silicon Valley by our community of advisors and our manager sitting there,
                          amongst the most progressive startup community. For the office space, if we can have that,
                          we are already building a network there, to send the founders of the startups, who will be
                          ready to be accelerated. If initially we can't have that space, they can be accelerated from
                          Silicon Valley(by our manager & board of advisors sitting there) while they are in India.
                          Look at our portfolio opportunities, and if you feel there can be future values made out of
                          this & even if one is successful, and you think its worth your time, then please come on
                          board. Sharing substantial portions of this business with you or anyone you recommend will
                          be our pleasure - we can come on papers almost immediately to have this deal.
